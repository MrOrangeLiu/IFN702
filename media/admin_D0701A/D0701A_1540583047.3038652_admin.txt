</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Klansmen testified that King encouraged them to
burn black churches.King postponed one church fire, fearing the
Klan would be suspected.</P>
<P>
   King's attorney, Gary White of Columbia, S.C., relied on a First
Amendment defense: Derogatory remarks about blacks are protected
free speech.</P>
<P>
   ``That's not an easy pitch to a jury,'' White said.``It was
ugly and inflammatory, but that's what the First Amendment is all
about.''</P>
<P>
   White dismissed the notion that the judgment had a financial
impact on the Christian Knights since King owns only ``a couple of
acres and a small, run-down house on it.''</P>
<P>
   However, Richard Cohen, legal director of the Southern Poverty
Law Center, argues that huge damage awards ripple down to Klan foot
soldiers.</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he is likely to lose his home is probably not
the kind of thing he would just shrug off,'' Cohen said.``That's
the kind of thing that has a lasting impact.When you're going off
to the Klan rally and you're saying goodbye to your wife, she's not
real happy about the prospect that if you get involved with these
people you may lose your home.''</P>
<P>
   Tactics questioned
</P>
<P>
   Collecting evidence that will convince juries of clear-cut
conspiracies costs a bundle.Dees estimates the Manning
investigation cost nearly $100,000 _ $500,000 if attorney time had
been charged.</P>
<P>
   Which is why the law center devotes so much to fund-raising.</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1997, it raised $102 million, according to its
federal tax filings.Seventy-four cents of every dollar raised came
from more than 300,000 private contributors.During the same time,
the group spent $15 million on fund-raising _ more than 22 cents of
every dollar consumed by total expenses.</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the law center started with an endowment of $72,775.Its goal was to raise enough money to permanently fund its mission
of helping minorities litigate against civil rights abuses.</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the endowment topped $90 million _ $89.6 million of it
invested in equity securities.The organization's net assets
exceeded $97 million.</P>
<P>
   Located in the same block as Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, which
was once pastored by the Rev.Martin Luther King Jr., the law
center will begin construction next month of a $10 million,
six-story expansion across the street from its headquarters.</P>
<P>
   Dees drew a $205,339 salary in 1996 as the center's chief trial
counsel and chairman of its executive committee.He contributed
$19,458 to the employee benefit plan, according to the center's
1996 federal tax form.</P>
<P>
   Tom Turnipseed, a Columbia lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for
South Carolina attorney general last November, helped Dees get in
touch with Macedonia Baptist Church.</P>
<P>
   ``Morris loves to raise money,'' said Turnipseed, a distant
relative of Dees'.``Some of his gimmicks are just so transparent _
but they're good.He knows how to get people to give him the
money.''</P>
<P>
   In a recent fund-raising letter, Turnipseed said, his return
envelope came with ``about six different stamps.It was like they
had to cobble them all together to come up with 35 cents.''</P>
<P>
   Smaller civil rights groups, like the Center for Democratic
Renewal in Atlanta, which started as the Anti-Klan Network, wonder
why the law center needs so much money.</P>
<P>
   ``It appears they're just sitting on it.The community doesn't
see the product,'' said Chris Freeman, a Center for Democratic
Renewal researcher who relies on statistics from the Montgomery
group.``But the question is: Where are the funds going?Their
research is geared to groups like us, but there's nothing in the
com- munity.''</P>
<P>
   The criticism turns to vitriol among hate leaders, who lob their
bombast in newsletters and on the Internet.Tom Metzger, head of
the White Aryan Resistance, lost a $12.5 million suit in 1990 to
Dees for inspiring the beating death of an Ethiopian immigrant.He
pays $845 a month to the victim's estate.Less than affectionately,
Metzger calls his nemesis ``Morris Sleaze.''</P>
<P>
   ``Sleazy must be given credit where credit is due,'' Metzger
once wrote.``He has compiled the largest direct mail financial
sucker list in the country.''</P>
<P>
   The core of the law center's program is ``Teaching Tolerance,''
a classroom program started in 1991.A magazine that promotes
``interracial and intercultural understanding'' goes to more than
400,000 teachers.The program features books, videos and posters
costing up to $30 each.</P>
<P>
   The law center also funds a three-year, $100,000 civil rights
litigation program in Georgia.The program is designed to stem
federal cutbacks in programs that had provided free legal
assistance to poor people in civil actions.</P>
<P>
   Mouzon, the Macedonia pastor, said he doesn't begrudge the law
center one cent.``Not at all,'' he said, ``because we know
firsthand what they do.He knew we didn't have any money to accept
representation.''</P>
<P>
   THEY TEND TO RUN
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon sun pours a honey-colored glow into Young's
Country Mart near Manning, pallet makers from a nearby mill buy
quart bottles of Colt 45 malt liquor at the counter.``Maybe a few
of them graduated from high school,'' said Jesse Young, a trustee
at Macedonia Baptist and a former deputy sheriff who runs the
convenience store.One of the regulars is Romeo Haley.His brother
is Arthur, a Klansman who testified against the real big shots _
Horace King and Virgil Griffin, the main defendants in the
Macedonia fire.</P>
<P>
   Stopping in to buy gas and chicken tenders, Romeo Haley says
race relations have stayed the same since the lawsuit.``I don't
think it's changed except that people have hid themselves and run.Everybody that was in the Klan has run from the Klan.''Haley said
he ``never had no use'' for the Klan.</P>
<P>
   ``They're just poor rednecks looking for some kind of cause,''
he said.``They're fed up with the federal government, but they'll
get scared and run in a minute.There are people who planted the
tree and fertilized the tree but when it bore fruit, they ran.''</P>
<P>
   Since the civil verdict, a healing spirit has touched Macedonia.Mouzon plans a church picnic for his country community.Timothy
Welch, one of those convicted for setting the blaze, grew up in the
area, climbing a pecan tree just outside the church and playing
with church members' kids.</P>
<P>
   Mouzon sent him a letter saying no one in the church had grown
to hate him.Welch's mother, Wanda, has attended recent Sunday
services.Each time, she apologized to the congregation.</P>
<P>
   But there's no need, Mouzon said.All is forgiven.</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to move past it,'' he said.``It comes up
occasionally.But we're trying to forget.''</P>
<P>
   FINANCING LAWSUITS FOR THE POOR
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center has accumulated enough wealth in
recent years to embark on a major construction project and to have
assets totaling around $100 million.But the civil rights
organization still spends most of its money on programs to help
poor people.(Figures below are in millions).</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been six years since Sinead O'Connor earned a permanent
place in the Hall of Fierce when she shredded a photograph of Pope
John Paul II, and intoned, ``Fight the real enemy,'' on ``Saturday
Night Live.''Sure, she evoked the wrath of Catholics, including a
hypocritical Madonna.But it was a refreshingly candid moment in an
industry lousy with pretense.Here was a beautiful woman who
desexualized herself by shaving her head, a fiesty zealot with the
voice of an angry angel forever raging against the machine.She
championed Public Enemy, flipped off the Grammys, and was
threatened by Frank Sinatra for boycotting the Star-Spangled
Banner.Her actions were so jaw-droppingly over, it was hard not to
admire their raw loopiness, though they overshadowed her talent and
undermined record sales.</P>
<P>
   Now 31 and twice a mother, O'Connor seems a bit less prickly.In
the current  &UR; Spin &LR; , O'Connor, on the road this suumer as part of
the Lilith Fair, tells writer Chris Norris she has few regrets
about actions which brought her grief in the past.``I respect
myself for being the age that I was and having this passion and
integrity that I did have,'' she says.``I can say about the Pope
thing, I'm very proud of that and I stand by it and I would do it
again.Quite a lot of the other things _ like the national anthem
and the Grammys _ I wouldn't do now because they're just
(expletive) young moody (expletive).''Likewise, she has little
regard for you musical descendants whose rage seems more like a
fashion accessory.``I suppose it bothers me that people like them
have sold a lot more records than I ever sold.They don't cause
trouble and they play a game.They're not controversial in any
way.''</P>
<P>
   Speaking of playing games, is Jesse Camp for real?Is Camp,
anointed the newest idiot in MTV's village after beating 4,000
others in the network's ``I Wanna Be a VJ'' contest in April,
really the lovable geek-stoner he claims to be or is he pulling one
of his wool leg warmers over our eyes?It seems like it may be the
latter.His dad, J. Holden Camp, chairman of the humanities
department at the University of Hartford, tells Spin his son, whose
real name is Josh, ``is a good sweet kid who has created a bit of a
facade.He did well in school, and he had a lot of fun with
drama.''Looks like he still is.</P>

   &UR; P.O.V.&LR; , &UR;  &LR; the men's magazine which is Details without urban
cool or female readership, continues to genuflect to the guilt-free
guyness which (thankfully) hasn't been on public display since
Frank, Dean, and Sammy rampaged through the Sands Hotel.

John Yeager, a skinhead from
California, leaped into the back of the pickup, armed with a
semiautomatic rifle.The Keenans fled, with the guards _ three or
more in all _ pursuing them.</P>
<P>
   Yeager, Keenan told the police, fired five rounds from an
assault rifle as the guards bore down on her car, screaming for her
to pull over.When a bullet flattened the Keenans' rear tire, their
car slid into a ditch.Their pursuers ran up to them.</P>
<P>
   Keenan said a man, later identified as Warfield, struck her with
a rifle butt, grabbed her by the hair and screamed at her.Other
men tried to pull her weeping son out of the car, she said,
striking him with a bat and the butt of a rifle.</P>
<P>
   A gun ``was pointed at me,'' Keenan told the authorities.``It
made me very scared.I thought I was going to die.''She begged
them to leave her son alone.After determining that the Keenans
were unarmed, the men relented, explaining that they were doing so
because both were white, she said.</P>
<P>
   Witnesses are expected to testify that as a result of the
assault, Keenan and her son suffer from post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression and anxiety.</P>
<P>
   In court documents, Edgar J. Steele, a lawyer representing
Butler, Teague and the Aryan Nations, pointed out that on the night
of the attack, the volunteer guards made no effort to notify Butler
of their actions.``Wright, Yeager and Warfield were way out of
bounds, and they knew it,'' Steele argued.``One can only do so
much.''</P>
<P>
   He said Dees and his legal team were trying ``to paint this
ragtag band of borderline derelicts as a highly organized,
well-trained and disciplined military organization.''That, he
said, would be ``laughable if not so patently preposterous.''</P>
<P>
   In the 27 years since he moved to northern Idaho from
California, Butler and his organization have welcomed many white
supremacists later convicted of violent crimes.</P>
<P>
   One of the best known, and a model for the Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy J. McVeigh, was Robert Mathews, who in 1983 formed a
terrorist group known as the Order.Mathews and members of his gang
robbed armored cars, bombed a synagogue in Boise and assassinated
Alan Berg, a Jewish talk-show host in Denver.Mathews died in a
siege by the FBI in 1984, and other members of the organization are
serving federal prison sentences of 40 to 100 years.</P>
<P>
   Butler himself and 12 other white supremacist leaders were
arrested in 1987 on federal sedition charges but were acquitted at
trial in Fort Smith, Ark.</P>
<P>
   Mark Thomas, the leader of the Aryan Nations in Pennsylvania,
confessed to being part of another terrorist group, the Aryan
Republican Army, that in the mid-1990s robbed 22 Midwestern banks
in an effort to finance a white supremacist revolution.</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, the Southern Poverty Law Center has
taken the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups to court, starting
with a successful suit against the Invisible Empire Klan, which in
1979 attacked a group of peaceful civil rights marchers in Decatur,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the center won a $7 million verdict for the mother of
Michael Donald, a black youth who had been lynched by members of
the United Klans of America in Mobile, Ala.The group was forced to
turn its headquarters over to the victim's mother, and two Klansmen
were convicted of criminal charges.</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the center won a large verdict against Klan groups and
members for an assault on peaceful civil rights marchers in Forsyth
County, Ga., on Jan. 17, 1987.The Invisible Empire, the major Klan
defendant, was forced to disband, and the group's office equipment
went to the NAACP.</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the center also sued Tom and John Metzger, founders
of a group called the White Aryan Resistance, in 1990 after
skinhead followers of theirs from Portland, Ore., killed Mulugeta
Seraw, an Ethiopian student.A jury awarded the victim's family
$12.5 million.</P>

NOVEL PROVIDES AMMUNITION FOR HATE 
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material is for use only by

purchase information see end of text.By BILL MAXWELL 
 &HT;    Several years ago, when Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law
Center initiated a letter-writing campaign to dissuade bookstore
chains and distributors from stocking William Pierce's novel ``The
Turner Diaries,'' much of America thought the KlanWatch founder was
overreacting to the violence of a handful of white supremacists.&HT;    Now, with increasing numbers of white males targeting and
gunning down members of minority groups, Dees' failed book-banning
campaign _ although still unreasonable to most Americans, myself
included, on First Amendment grounds _ is not as unpalatable as it
once was.&HT;    The reason is that ``The Turner Diaries'' serves as a bible for
killers such as Tim McVeigh and Ben Smith and L.A. day camp
shooting suspect Buford Furrow.&HT;    Published in 1978 and set in the 1990s, the novel depicts
Armageddon between select whites and everyone else _ blacks, Jews,
government officials, journalists, cops, military personnel.&HT;    At this time, called the ``Day of the Rope,'' tens of thousands
of blacks and Jews are exterminated.This also is when the
``Organization'' eradicates liberalism, feminism and the other isms
of compassion.&HT;    Amazingly, very few people besides scholars, terrorism experts
and, of course, white extremists have read ``The Turner Diaries.''Even more shocking, at least to me, is that so few journalists have
read it.&HT;    The following edited excerpts from the novel should give readers
a glimpse of what our home-grown terrorists are reading for
inspiration:
 &HT;    ``Liberalism is an essentially feminine, submissive world view.Perhaps a better adjective than feminine is infantile.It is the
world view of men who do not have the moral toughness, the
spiritual strength to stand up and do single combat with life, who
cannot adjust to the reality that the world is not a huge,
pink-and-blue, padded nursery in which the lions lie down with the
lambs and everyone lives happily ever after.''&HT;    ``One day we will have a truly American press in this country,
but a lot of editors' throats will have to be cut first.''&HT;    ```Women's lib' was a form of mass psychosis which broke out
during the last three decades of the Old Era.Women affected by it
denied their femininity and insisted that they were `people,' not
`women.'''&HT;    ``There is no way a society based on Aryan values and an Aryan
outlook can evolve peacefully from a society which has succumbed to
Jewish spiritual corruption.''&HT;    ``The (Uncle) `Toms' will eventually get their more militant and
resentful brethren back into line, but meanwhile Izzy and Sambo are
really at one another's throats, tooth and nail, and it is a joy to
behold.''&HT;    ``The hanging of a few of the worst race-criminals in every
neighborhood in America will help enormously in straightening out
the majority of the population and reorienting their thinking.In
fact, it will not only help, but it is absolutely necessary.The
people require a strong psychological shock to break old habits of
thought.''&HT;    ``Talk of `innocents' has no meaning.We must look at our
situation collectively, in a race-wide sense.We must understand
that our race is like a cancer patient undergoing drastic surgery
in order to save his life.There is no sense in asking whether the
tissue being cut out is `innocent' or not.That is no more
reasonable than trying to distinguish the `good' Jews from the bad
ones _ or, as some of our thicker-skulled `good ol' boys' still
insist on trying, separating the `good niggers' from the rest of
their race.''&HT;    ``We'll go to the uttermost ends of the earth to hunt down the
last of Satan's spawn.''&HT;    After the Organization conquers the world with nuclear weapons,
the ``Great One'' hands down a final edict: ``It (is) no longer
sufficient to be merely white; in order to eat one (has) to be
judged the bearer of especially valuable genes.''&HT;    After the Oklahoma City bombing, Pierce, aka Andrew Macdonald,
who holds a doctorate in physics and is a former professor in
Oregon, quipped that ``someone may have read` The Turner
Diaries.'''&HT;    An understatement, for sure.As head of the Neo-Nazi National
Alliance, the biggest and most active of such groups nationwide,
Pierce invites at least 100 members who possess what he calls
``leadership potential'' to a private workshop each year at the
Hillboro, W.Va., headquarters.There, the future stalwarts, who
mistake paranoia for patriotism, are trained in the civilized art
of hatred.&HT;    The main training manual?``The Turner Diaries.''Besides these
100 crazies who are required to read the book each year, many
others, such as McVeigh, Smith and Furrow, discover it in their own
way and re-enact its graphic mayhem.&HT;    -----

<HEADLINE> Jury: Aryans To Pay $6.3M in Suit  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN K. WILEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- A jury on Thursday awarded $6.3
million to a woman and her son who were attacked by Aryan Nations
guards outside the white supremacist group's north Idaho
headquarters.</P>
<P>
   The jury found that Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler, the
group and its corporate entity, Saphire, Inc., were negligent in
the selection, training and supervision of the security guards who
assaulted Victoria and Jason Keenan two years ago.</P>
<P>
   The Keenans' attorney, Morris Dees, had asked the jury to award
more than $11 million in punitive damages.Dees, of the Montgomery,
Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center, has said he hoped the
penalty would be severe enough to bankrupt the Aryan Nations.</P>
<P>
   The 82-year-old Butler spoke briefly outside the courtroom,
comparing himself to some biblical figures and also declaring
northern Idaho a haven for racists.</P>
<P>
   ''This is nothing,'' Butler said.''We have planted seeds.Most
of north Idaho now is filled with the people who escaped
multiculturalism or diversity or whatever you want to call it.''</P>
<P>
   Jurors set $6 million as a punitive damage award, with $330,000
in compensatory damages to the Keenans, who were chased, shot at
and assaulted after they stopped to search for a dropped wallet
near the entrance to the Aryan Nations' compound.</P>
<P>
   Dees said he doesn't intend to allow the defendants to begin
disposing of their assets.</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to enforce this verdict.We intend to take every
single asset from the Aryan Nations now and forever,'' he said.''We intend to even take the name Aryan Nations and hopefully,
through the judicial process, close that sad chapter in this
nation's history.''</P>
<P>
   Victoria Keenan, 44, spoke briefly, thanking the jury, her
lawyers and her family.''Without them, I don't think I could have
done all this,'' she said.</P>
<P>
   Edgar Steele, who represents Butler and the Aryan Nations, said
he will move for a new trial.If that fails, he will appeal and may
also seek to have the judgment amount reduced.Butler would have to
post a $9 million bond to appeal.</P>
<P>
   ''I consider this area to be one of the last bastions of free
speech in America,'' Steele said.''You can write the epitaph for
that now.''</P>
<P>
   The jury found Butler, the Aryan Nations and Saphire Inc. 90
percent negligent and liable for $4.8 million of the award.Butler's chief of staff, Michael Teague, was found 10 percent
negligent and liable for $600,000.</P>
<P>
   The former guards Jesse Warfield and John Yeager -- who are
serving prison terms for the assaults on the Keenans -- were also
found liable for punitive damages.Yeager was assessed $100,000 in
punitive damages and Warfield $500,000 in punitive damages.</P>
<P>
   The jury also awarded Victoria Keenan $250,000 and Jason Keenan
$80,000 in compensatory damages.</P>
<P>
   Steele blamed the two guards and argued Butler was not
responsible.Steele said that Warfield and Yeager were drunk --
against regulations -- when they attacked the Keenans on the evening
of July 1, 1998.</P>
<P>
   Warfield and Yeager, who represented themselves, took
responsibility for the attack, but steadfastly refusing to
implicate Butler.They said they mistook a car backfire as gunfire
from the Keenans and perceived a threat.</P>
<P>
   Steele said Butler preaches nonviolence, except in self-defense.</P>
<P>
   Butler tried to distance himself from the actions of Warfield,
Yeager and a third former guard, whom he called unpaid volunteers.

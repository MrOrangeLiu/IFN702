   A Missile Defense Strategy That Will Have to Wait  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton left to his successor the decision on whether
to deploy a national missile defense system.He said he would not
do so himself because of test failures and diplomatic disputes.The
president, speaking at Georgetown University, said he had decided
not to act after two huge $100 million tests of the system failed
to intercept incoming missiles.</P>
<P>
   Clinton said more time is also needed to find a diplomatic
solution to what has been a growing confrontation between the
United States and Russia and China, staunch opponents to a U.S.
missile defense.</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temps, Unite  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The labor movement has long been eager to unionize temp workers
because they are such a fast-growing group and because they often
receive inferior pay and benefits.But for years they were off
limits because they were not allowed to join unions unless the user
company and temp agency agreed _ something that rarely happened.The National Labor Relations Board opened the door to forming such
unions by ruling that they no longer needed the temp agency's
permission to do so.</P>
<P>
   Awards After an Uprising
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 former inmates who were beaten during the 1971
Attica prison uprising will split $8 million as part of a
settlement with New York state, a federal judge ruled.The awards,
which range from $6,500 to $125,000, punctuate a protracted legal
battle stemming from the uprising, in which 43 people died.Still,
the judge said many survivors ``remain casualties because of
lingering physical problems and the inability to erase memories of
Attica.''</P>
<P>
   No Terminator, Please
</P>
<P>
   The computer scientists at Brandeis University have created the
first robotic system that can design and build other robots with
almost no human help.The technique will merely speed up the
process of designing robots, said Dr. Jordan B. Pollack, a
professor of computer science at Brandeis and one of the
researchers, and sharply drop the cost.</P>
<P>
   Crime Continues to Decline
</P>
<P>
   Violent crime in the United States dropped last year to its
lowest level since the government began its annual national crime
survey 26 years ago.Law enforcement officials credited
crime-prevention programs, anti-gun campaigns, more police on the
street, tougher sentencing and a healthy economy producing jobs.The rate of violent crime declined 10.4 percent in 1999, the
Justice Department said, while crimes against property dropped 8.9
percent.But there still were an estimated 28.8 million violent and
property crimes committed last year.</P>
<P>
   The French and Corsica
</P>
<P>
   A plan by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France to give limited
self-rule to the island of Corsica has caused turmoil in France's
political class and led Interior Minister Jean Pierre Chevenement
to resign in protest.</P>
<P>
   Any degree of regional autonomy is a deeply sensitive
constitutional issue in France.But the plan has also gained wide
backing, including from Corsicans, because it aims to strengthen
moderates and end the violent campaign of separatists, who have
thrown bombs and practiced political killings for almost three
decades.</P>
<P>
   Next, the Aryan Nations  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to seize the compound of the Aryan Nations, Morris
S. Dees Jr. went to court in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.Dees, founder of
the Southern Poverty Law Center, has won a series of civil right
suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations in a
campaign to drive them out of business.The Aryan Nations compound
has been a base for white supremacists for more than 20 years.</P>
<P>
   His suit contends that compound guards, the Aryan Nations, its
82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and his second in
command, Michael Teague, should be held liable for an attack on a
woman and her son, both white, by the guards in July 1998.Dees'
goal is to win a large judgment that will force the group to
surrender their compound in payment.</P>
<P>
   Immigrant Influx in Nevada
</P>
<P>
   By one measure, at least, the future of America seems to be at
the gambling table.The Census Bureau estimated that jobs in Las
Vegas lured so many people that Nevada grew the fastest of any
state in the 1990s, with its population rising 50 percent.Many of
those pouring in to build or staff casinos and hotels were
Hispanics and Asians, the nation's fastest-growing minority groups.California, though, still has the largest Hispanic population _
10.4 million, up 36 percent in a decade.</P>
<P>
   Eh, Get a Horse
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough week for Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The auto giant admitted it was aware of tire failures on
Explorer sport utility vehicles in Venezuela as early as 1998.</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge in Alameda County, Calif., Michael E.
Ballachey, largely agreed with complaints that Ford knowingly
installed defective ignition mechanisms in nearly two million Ford
vehicles produced from 1983 to 1995.The judge said he intended to
issue orders to recall and repair the vehicles.Analysts estimated
the cost could run as high as $250 million.</P>
<P>
   Ford refuted the finding, and predicted it would be reversed on
appeal.</P>
<P>
   A New Trial for American
</P>
<P>
   After an election marred by charges of voter fraud, President
Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru no doubt needs all the friends he can
get.That could well explain Peru's decision to grant a new trial
to Lori Berenson, the New Yorker who in 1996 was tried in secret
before masked judges and sentenced to life imprisonment for
terrorism.The case has been a thorn ever since in relations
between Washington and Lima, but human rights officials remained
wary, fearing that a new trial would be no fairer than the first.</P>
<P>
   A Finding on Death Row  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all Texas murder defendants get a decent courtroom defense.Not in the case of Delma Banks Jr., who was sent to death row in
1980.His lawyer, a former district attorney, failed ``to
investigate or interview punishment-phase witnesses,'' a federal
magistrate later found.On Aug. 18, David Folsom, a U.S. District
judge in Texarkana, Texas, endorsed that finding, which was first
reported Wednesday in The Texarkana Gazette, and ordered either a
sentence reduction or new sentencing trial for Banks.</P>

CALIFORNIA JUDGE RULES REPORTER CAN REFUSE TO DISCLOSE MATERIALS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A judge has declined to order a reporter to
provide prosecutors and defense lawyers with notes and tape
recordings of an interview with a defendant in a racially charged
murder trial.</P>
<P>
   An FBI agent testified that the reporter told him that the
defendant, Randall Lee Rojas, had admitted committing a murder in
1995.He identified the reporter as Trish O'Kane, who writes for
Intelligence Report, a magazine of the Southern Poverty Law Center,
a civil rights group in Montgomery, Ala. Lawyers for two of Rojas'
co-defendants, Ritch Bryant and Jessica Colwell, sought the
material as evidence that their clients had no hand in the Nov. 25,
1995, beating death of a black man, Milton Walker Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing on Oct. 27, Judge Lance A. Ito of the Los Angeles
Superior Court said the interview contained ``nothing close to
being exculpatory'' for the defense.He noted the material would
assist the prosecution's case, but found the evidence was available
through other means and that there was no need to pierce
California's shield law, which essentially protects reporters from
being compelled to provide evidence to the government.</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center tracks hate groups, and
Intelligence Report covers right-wing extremists.Rojas' lawyer,
Donald Calabria, questioned how Ms. O'Kane had entered the Los
Angeles County Jail without filling out required media forms and
had interviewed his client without his knowledge.Judge Ito noted
that a Los Angeles sheriff's department investigator helped arrange
the interview and even participated, posing questions for Rojas.</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Kane disclosed a portion of the interview to an FBI agent
about a month later, though her editor, Mark Potok, said in an
interview that the disclosure was inadvertent and that the
magazine's reporters do not collaborate with law enforcement
authorities.</P>

   BRITAIN-RACE _ LONDON _ The 600-page report on the 1993 murder
of a17-year-old black man named Stephen Lawrence in 1993 places the
spotlight on the treatment of blacks in London and the rest of
Britain, and is being described as the first shot in a revolution
in race relations.The report makes damning criticisms of the
metropolitan London police, pointing out, perhaps for the first
time in Britain, institutional racism.It calls for widespread
reform throughout government and highlights a rarely discussed
problem in modern British society.The investigation was so marred
from the start that the five men accused of the crime will probably
never be punished.(Roughton, Cox News Service).</P>

will be the standing of African Americans at the end of the 21st
century?Displaced by Hispanics as the largest ethnic group - and
voting bloc - will they have the political clout to make demands?Or will there, in fact, be any reason for demands, assuming America
finally does become color blind?(Shepard, Cox News Service).</P>

   HATEGROUPS _ MANNING, S.C. _ An hour past midnight, pastor
Jonathan Mouzon sped toward his country church as fast as his Chevy
Lumina could carry him.A section of sky glowed the orange of a
fireball.Three days earlier, the Ku Klux Klan had nailed a flier
to the door of the Macedonia Baptist Church.A skull and crossbones
on the white paper illustrated an ominous warning: ``KKK _ is
watching you.''By the time he pulled up, what looked like a
tornado of fire churned from the middle of the church.Before
sunrise, Macedonia's ashes joined the heap of 400 other black
churches burned from 1993 to 1996.So when a white lawyer from
Alabama called offering to sue the Klan and win justice, some in
the Macedonia flock were skeptical.

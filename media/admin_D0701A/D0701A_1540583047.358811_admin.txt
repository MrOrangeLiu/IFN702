You can
practically smell aftershave on every page.So in addition to a
vodka primer _ Ketel One gets a A+ for its ``exceptionally clean
finish _ there's Scott Bindley's entertaining mini-opus, ``In
Defense of Bachelorhood.''According to Bindley, married life can
be can be a soul-sucking morass of soggy diapers, minivans, and sex
as often as the World Cup.Hence, men should be live it up as
bachelors.Singledom, he says, means more time and money for a cool
sports car, titanium golf clubs, and a satellite dish which can get
every sporting event from Little League to logrolling.But Bindley
is quick to say everything he writes ``is predicated on the belief
that the bachelor existence should be temporary.We are not
advocating starting up a local chapter of Spanky and Alfalfa's
He-Man Women-Haters Club.''</P>

   The women of  &UR; Bust &LR;  seem like they couldn't care less if they
make men uncomfortable.This smart New York-based quarterly is
dedicated to celebrating all things female, and if the boys can't
handle it, well, they don't have to go home, but they've got to the
heck the out of here.In short, chicks rule.This month's edition
is the Girlfriends issue, an ode to those faithful women who help
us through our lives, those who are the Marys to our Rhodas, the
Lavernes to our Shirleys.There's Donna Lovell's too-true feature,
``Six Reasons Why Your Girlfriend is Better Than a Boyfriend,'' and
``Bosom Buddies,'' a funny meditation of the best girlfriends of
all time, including Lucy and Ethel, Cagney and Lacy, Patsy and
Edina of the late great ``Absolutely Fabulous.''</P>

   For nearly a decade, Queen Latifah, the first lady of hip-hop,
has been bobbing and weaving questions about whether she prefers
princesses to princes in her queendom.Speculation on her sexuality
only intensified after she played a lesbian bank robber in the 1996
urban caper ``Set It Off.''So in the current issue of  &UR; The Source,
 &LR; she pumps ``Order in the Court,'' her first CD in five years, and
gives a shout-out to the late Biggie Smalls.Mostly, though, she
talks about those rumors.``I have no problems with my sexuality,
whatever you wanna think I am,'' the woman born Dana Owens tells
writer Amy Linden.``I'll never answer the question.I'd rather
have you die wanting to know.You can assume whatever you want.I'm
me.I'm not ashamed of who I am, and who I sleep with is nobody's
businesses.''Which is very similar to what George Michael used to
say before he came out earlier this year _ not that there's
anything wrong with that.</P>
<P>
   In the same issue, Morris Dees, leader of the Southern Poverty
Law Center, gets an unwarranted slap in the MediaWatch column.Dees
has always gotten props for dropping dimes on the hateful
activities of such groups as the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nation.But
then Dees added the Nation of Islam to SPLC's list of hate groups.Writes Brett Johnson, ``If you want to make friends and influence
people in the 'hood, dissing (Louis) Farrakhan and the Nation is
not the place to start.''But since Farrakhan has made
anti-Semitic remarks, as well as homophobic and misogynistic
comments, he belongs on Dees's list.So to the Source, that slap is
right back at 'cha.</P>

LEADERS OF ARYAN NATIONS FOUND NEGLIGENT IN ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Issuing a verdict that civil rights
organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest
white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a
state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan
Nations to pay more than $6 million to the victims of an attack two
years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's
compound near here.</P>
<P>
   Richard Girnt Butler, the 82-year-old self-described pastor of
the Aryan Nations compound, and his deputy, Michael Teague, were
ordered to pay most of the $6.3 million in damages by the
nine-woman, three-man jury.</P>
<P>
   The findings, delivered late Thursday afternoon in the Kootenai
County Courthouse, prompted tearful hugs among the plaintiffs, a
mother and son who were beaten and shot at in the attack, and their
lawyers.The defendants responded defiantly outside the courthouse,
even as protesters shouted at them to stop their ``message of
hate.''</P>
<P>
   The verdict was obtained by lawyers for the Southern Poverty Law
Center, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala., that has
successfully sued the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations.</P>
<P>
   Morris S. Dees Jr., a founder of the center, hailed the jury's
finding as a powerful message against racial intolerance and one
that could force the group out of its 19-acre property.``I'd like
to say publicly for Butler to get the message that we consider the
every single asset of that compound to be the property of the
plaintiffs in this case,'' Dees said after the verdict was
announced.</P>
<P>
   The multimillion-dollar award also represented the kind of
message from the community that many civic leaders here had openly
sought, hoping that it might help the area to shed what they called
North Idaho's distorted image as a haven for people with racist
views.</P>
<P>
   But Butler scoffed at the verdict, variously comparing himself
to figures in the Bible and to signers of the Declaration of
Independence who were harassed for their views.``This is
nothing,'' he said, after the verdict.``We have planted seeds.''</P>
<P>
   Said Teague: ``The message doesn't take a lot of money.We will
spread the message.''</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son, Jason, now
21, who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the
Aryan Nations in July 1998, had asked the jury for nearly $12
million in compensatory and punitive damages.</P>
<P>
   But the larger purpose of the lawsuit was to bankrupt the Aryan
Nations compound, limit Butler's ability to spread a gospel of
racial hate and persuade the jury to ``return a verdict that will
be heard all over this nation,'' a lawyer for the Keenans, Dees
said in closing arguments.</P>
<P>
   Butler's lawyer, Edgar Steele, argued throughout the six-day
trial that however offensive jurors might find the views of Butler,
he should not be held responsible for the actions of a group of
drunken young men.</P>
<P>
   Steele said the Aryan Nations property was not the incubator of
violence that Dees had portrayed it to be.</P>
<P>
   ``What goes on at Pastor Butler's property,'' he told the
jurors, ``is really more akin to a homeless shelter for exceedingly
politically incorrect misfits, malcontents, borderline derelicts
and all manner of people that drift in and out.''</P>
<P>
   Keenan and her son were attacked after stopping their car near
the entrance to the 19-acre Aryan Nations property near Hayden
Lake, about 20 miles north of here, on their way home from a
wedding.They were looking for a wallet that Keenan had
accidentally dropped from their 1977 Datsun.He had been in the Job
Corps and had thrown his Job Corps card out the window on a whim
and, inadvertently, his wallet along with it.He quickly retrieved
the wallet, but when the car started, it backfired, Keenan told the
police after the incident.</P>
<P>
   At the compound, three guards, one of whom later told the police
that he had thought the place was about to be attacked by militant
Jews, picked up their guns, jumped in a pickup truck and chased the
car.They shot at the car, flattening a rear tire and forcing the
car into a ditch.</P>
<P>
   In tearful testimony, Keenan said one guard, Jesse Warfield, 45,
struck her with the butt of a rifle, grabbed her by the hair and
screamed at her.She and her son testified that they thought they
were going to be killed.</P>
<P>
   Keenan said that she begged the men not to kill her son and that
one of the guards then asked her if she was Indian.She testified
that while she is part Cherokee, she told the men, ``No, I'm a poor
white farm girl.''A guard then said that because they were white,
the men would let them go.</P>
<P>
   At the trial, another security guard, John Yeager, 21, testified
that he was too drunk that night to remember whether he or the
other men had fired at the Keenans.Under questioning, Yeager read
portions of a letter from jail in which he expressed his allegiance
to Butler, saying, ``Next to Christ you are the greatest man to
ever walk the face of this earth.''</P>
<P>
   Yeager and Warfield have pleaded guilty to criminal assault and
are in prison, while the third guard, Shane Wright, 23, remained a
fugitive.The two imprisoned men were brought here for the trial
and testified that they were responsible for their actions, a point
repeated by Steele.</P>

<HEADLINE> Supremacist Wanted Everyone Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- A white supremacist arrested after buying  
hand grenades from an undercover agent said he wanted to send mail 
bombs to Washington and Montgomery, authorities said.</P>
<P>
	Chris Scott Gilliam said he didn't want to be like the  
Unabomber, who killed three person and wounded several others, a 
federal agent testified at a federal court hearing.</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to kill everybody,'' David Pasqualotto, a special  
agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said 
Friday.</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate indication what agencies or people might  
have been targeted in the national and state capital cities.An ATF 
representative did not immediately return calls for comment 
Saturday.</P>
<P>
	Gilliam, 27, was charged with possessing an unregistered firearm  
found at his home in Foley along with what agents said was 
apparently a silencer.</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Gary Arm said at the hearing that Gilliam  
legally owned the firearm and has no criminal record.</P>
<P>
	A federal magistrate ordered him held pending the results of a  
psychological evaluation.</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Gilliam, could face six or seven years in prison,  
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Bordenkircher.No charges were 
immediately filed in connection with the grenade purchase.</P>
<P>
	Pasqualotto testified that Gilliam met with him Thursday,  
arriving with a loaded, cocked .45-caliber pistol on his hip and 
his 20-month-old son in his arms.</P>
<P>
	``I knew he wasn't quite right,'' Pasqualotto said.</P>
<P>
	The investigation started three weeks earlier when Gilliam  
contacted a man about obtaining C4 high explosive, Pasqualotto 
testified.</P>
<P>
	He said Gilliam also told the informant someone should kill the  
FBI sniper who killed the wife of white supremacist Randy weaver 
during an 11-day standoff in 1992 at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, along with 
civil rights lawyer Morris Dees of the Montgomery-based Southern 
Poverty Law Center.</P>

STOPPING HATE BEFORE IT KILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The conviction of white supremacist John William
King last week for the murder of James Byrd Jr., a black man,
begins to bring closure to a horrific chapter in the nation's
history of race relations.</P>
<P>
   But the book didn't begin, nor will it end with the King trial,
as a report by the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law
Center demonstrates.According to the report, the number of hate
groups in the country increased again last year.</P>
<P>
   Hate and intolerance are dark threads deeply woven into our
society's fabric.They give rise to the environment that fostered
King's prejudices and threatens all communities, not just his own
in Jasper, Texas.</P>
<P>
   Consider his writings in the scrapbook of a fellow prison
inmate.In it, King professed, ``We, my Aryan Brother in arms, will
rightfully claim what's ours and in the end our feet will be washed
in the blood of the Jews.''</P>
<P>
   The scary thing is that King is only 24.He didn't evolve
overnight into the monster that killed Byrd.Neither did his moral
moorings come loose in a vacuum.King's hate steadily was fed,
tattoos on his body eventually mirroring the thoughts in his head:
a black man being lynched; a Madonna carrying a baby Jesus with
horns; Nazi symbols.</P>
<P>
   Other events throughout the country and even in Jasper show how
King might have arrived at this point.</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana last week, a white man was convicted of a hate
crime for trying to burn two cars belonging to black motorists.</P>
<P>
   And in Virginia Beach, Va., a 19-year-old man pleaded guilty to
trying to burn a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple.</P>
<P>
   In Jasper, school officials were haggling with the parents of a
student who, amid the raw feelings surrounding Byrd's death and
King's murder trial, found it fit to wear to class his Confederate
flag belt buckle.The boy's parents called in help from a nearby Ku
Klux Klan group when the boy was suspended for refusing to leave
his buckle at home.</P>
<P>
   While not murderous acts, they reveal an indifference to
humanity.For these folks, Byrd's brutal death was only a blip on
their screen, if they even bothered to blink.</P>
<P>
   Whites aren't immune from becoming hate-crime victims, but
groups that hate minorities, Jews and gays far outnumber other
separatist organizations.And, make no mistake, they're hungry for
more recruits.

</P>
<P>
   Warfield testified that he wasn't a member of the group when he,
Yeager and Wright jumped into his pickup with an assault rifle and
chased the Keenans' car after hearing a loud noise outside the
group's compound, north of Coeur D'Alene.</P>
<P>
   He said he only chased the Keenans, who are part-white and
part-American Indian, to try to find out who had paid them to shoot
at the compound.No weapon was found in the Keenans' car, and
authorities theorize the guards mistook a car backfire for a
gunshot.Warfield said he ''always acted as if I was security
chief, even though I wasn't appointed.''</P>
<P>
   Yeager said he was drunk and didn't recall shooting an assault
rifle at the Keenans' car.</P>
<P>
   Both men are representing themselves and testified that the
atmosphere surrounding the Aryan Nations compound in the months
leading up to a 1998 Aryan parade through town was one of
increasing paranoia that others would try to stop them.</P>
<P>
   The two denied lying to protect Butler, whom they consider to be
the protector of the white race.</P>
<P>
   Butler, 82, has also said the men acted on their own.Edgar
Steele, a lawyer representing Butler and the corporation that
controls Aryan assets, has said he fears the Aryans' beliefs will
be scrutinized by the jury rather than the evidence.The lawyers
for the Ayran Nations have not begun calling witnesses in the case.</P>
<P>
   Outside the Kootenai County Justice Building, security has been
tight since the trial began Monday.SWAT team members scan the
crowd with binoculars from atop the building, visitors must pass
through a metal detector and there is a daily lottery for courtroom
passes.</P>
<P>
   At one point, federal agents were posing as journalists in the
crowd to photograph neo-Nazi skinheads who had been rallying
outside the courthouse.The sheriff's department on Wednesday
revoked the agents' false credentials.</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Capt.Ben Wolfinger admitted he initially directed
seven agents to obtain media passes so they could blend in better
with photographers covering the trial.I was surprised it became an
issue,'' he said.</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the news media said it is dangerous for law
officers to pose as journalists.Such deceptions could lead to
physical threats against reporters, who are not armed, said Kyle
Niederpruem, national president of the Society of Professional
Journalists.</P>
<P>
   FBI officials did not immediately return messages for comment.</P>

<HEADLINE> Aryan Nations Threatened by Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- A lawyer who specializes in
bankrupting hate groups is going after the Aryan Nations, whose
compound in the Idaho woods has served as a clubhouse for some of
America's most violent racists.</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit that goes to trial Monday, attorney Morris Dees of
the Southern Poverty Law Center is representing a mother and son
who were attacked by security guards for the white supremacist
group.The victims are suing the Aryan Nations and founder Richard
Butler.</P>
<P>
   ''Put them out of business, that's what we try to do,'' Dees
said when the lawsuit was filed last year.He has declined
additional comment.</P>
<P>
   Butler said the lawsuit was brought by enemies of the white
race.</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way it is for the white man today,'' Butler, 82,
said Wednesday.''I think it's a rape of the American justice
system.''</P>
<P>
   The case has its origins on July 1, 1998, when Victoria Keenan,
43, and her son Jason, 20, were driving on a country road near
Hayden Lake.Their car backfired as it passed the Aryan Nations'
20-acre compound.</P>
<P>
   Security guards for the Aryan Nations mistook the backfire for a
gunshot, piled into a truck and chased the Keenans, who are part
white, part American Indian, for two miles.They fired five bullets
into the Keenan car and forced it off the road.Both Keenans were
punched and threatened at gunpoint before the guards backed off.</P>
<P>
   Two of the guards were convicted of assault and are in prison.A
third remains a fugitive.</P>
<P>
   The Keenans are alleging assault, false imprisonment and
emotional distress at the hands of the guards, who they contend
were agents of the Aryan Nations.They are seeking an unspecified
amount in compensatory and punitive damages.</P>
<P>
   Butler and his attorney Edgar Steele are expected to argue that
he should not be held liable for the actions of the volunteer
security guards.Steele did not return a call.</P>
<P>
   In court documents, Steele described the security guards as
''borderline derelicts'' who were not under Butler's control.</P>
<P>
   Butler's beliefs should not be used against him, the defense
documents said, ''Demonizing Jews is still legal under the First
Amendment.''</P>
<P>
   Dees has long used lawsuits to destroy the finances of hate
groups.In six such lawsuits, the Montgomery, Ala., lawyer has
never lost.</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Dees won a $7 million verdict against a Ku Klux Klan
organization over the slaying of a 19-year-old black man in Mobile,
Ala., forcing the group to turn over its headquarters building.In
1990, he won $9 million in Portland, Ore., against the White Aryan
Resistance in the beating death of a black man by neo-Nazi
skinheads.</P>
<P>
   The Portland case is similar to the Keenan lawsuit, in that Dees
argued that White Aryan Resistance founders Tom and John Metzger
incited the skinheads to commit murder.</P>
<P>
   Dees has received death threats in the past, so the Southern
Poverty Law Center will have its own security force to augment the
tight security promised by Kootenai County authorities.</P>
<P>
   Butler is pastor of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, which
holds that whites are the true children of God, that Jews are the
offspring of Satan and that blacks and other minorities are
inferior.He presides over weekly services in a chapel where an
Israeli flag is used as a doormat.</P>
<P>
   Over the years, his disciples have included some of the most
notorious figures in the white supremacist movement, such as Robert
Mathews, Randy Weaver and Buford Furrow, a former security guard at
the Aryan Nations compound who is awaiting trial in Los Angeles on
charges of killing an Asian-American postal carrier and shooting up
a Jewish day care center last summer.</P>
<P>
   Butler, however, has been largely able to escape jail time.In
1988 he was acquitted of federal charges that he was involved in a
plot to overthrow the government.</P>
<P>
   People who study hate groups consider Butler a godfather of the
white supremacist movement.</P>
<P>
   From his compound, which is valued at about $200,000 and has a
sign out front that reads ''Whites only,'' Butler mails his
literature, recruits followers and plays host to the annual Aryan
World Congress, a skinhead symposium that often draws more than 100
acolytes.The gathering is generally held on Adolf Hitler's
birthday.</P>
<P>
   Butler said the possible loss of his home ''bothers me a little
bit.''He is appealing for defense funds from neo-Nazi
sympathizers, writing on his Web site: ''We must not let the
enemies of our race win this round.''</P>
<P>
   Six distributors of skinhead music are donating proceeds from
the sale of CDs with titles like ''Too White for You,'' and
''Holocaust 2000.''</P>
<P>
   Vincent Bertollini, a wealthy former computer executive who
lives in nearby Sandpoint, Idaho, sent a mailing to thousands of
Idaho households last week attacking Dees as an ''anti-white, Jew
supremacist.''</P>
<P>
   ''Just think about it,'' Bertollini's mailing said.''A Jew team
of lawyers trying to destroy a white Christian church.''</P>
<P>
   Dees is not Jewish.</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Aryan Nations are looking forward to seeing the
group punished.</P>
<P>
   Bill Wassmuth, whose Coeur d'Alene home was once bombed by white
supremacists, said it is important to hold leaders of hate groups
responsible for the actions of their followers.</P>
<P>
   ''Will a successful outcome eliminate hate groups in the
Northwest?No,'' Wassmuth said.''Will it have an impact?Most
certainly.''</P>

   The Good News About `Going Postal'
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, 1986, an Oklahoma postal worker shot and killed 14
co-workers, then himself.In the years since, there have been other
incidents of violence and murder, sometimes multiple murder, by
current or former postal workers.</P>
<P>
   On Aprril 17, 1994, in his ``On Language'' column in The New
York Times Magazine, William Safire discussed whether ``going
postal'' meant ``losing it'' or ``not being online.''It was the
first time that ``going postal'' appeared in The Times.</P>
<P>
   The rest is linguistic history.Three-year-olds know what going
postal means.</P>
<P>
   Is the Postal Service happy about this?Not at all.So, calmly,
it commissioned a lengthy study on workplace safety, a study that _
with charts and myriad statistics _ strikes out at the notion that
your friendly letter carrier is likely, at any moment, to whip an
Uzi out of his mail pouch.</P>
<P>
   ```Going postal' is a myth, a bad rap,'' the report says.``Postal workers are no more likely to physically assault, sexually
harass, or verbally abuse their coworkers than employees in the
national workforce.''Retail workers, it says, are eight times as
likely as postal workers to be victims of homicide at work.</P>
<P>
   The study is a serious one.``The level of violence throughout
the American workplace is unacceptably high,'' it says, and offers
a variety of remedies.But it also seems intent on clearing the
Postal Service's tainted name, noting that part of the problem is
that it has so many workers _ as a civilian employer, it's second
only to Wal-Mart.</P>
<P>
   But it will be rough.A new expression, once it has burst from
the starting gate, is awfully hard to call back.And ``going
Wal-Mart'' just doesn't work.</P>
<P>
   A Restaurant That's All Lobby
</P>
<P>
   Washington lobbyists, shod in tasseled loafers, once inspired
someone to describe their eager, sartorially enhanced gatherings
outside the closed doors of congressional hearing rooms as Gucci
Gulch.Now they have their own watering hole, the Caucus Room, and
the list of investors is top heavy with a who's who of lobbyocracy.</P>
<P>
   Which is why it has more private dining rooms than any other
Washington restaurant.Thomas H. Boggs Jr., one of its largest
investors and one of the town's best-known lobbyists (his father,
Hale, was a Democratic leader in the the House, his mother, Lindy,
a former congresswoman from Louisiana and now ambassador to the
Vatican), provided a simple explanation.So many closed doors, he
said, make it possible to keep people like House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, a Republican, and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, a
Democrat, from running into each other during fund-raising events.Not so incidentally, lobbyists can deduct as much of their visits
as business expenses as possible _ 100 percent for a banquet, but
only 50 percent for a regular meal.</P>
<P>
   The roster of the Caucus Room's 65 shareholders includes Michael
Brown, the son of the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, as well as
James Lake, the deputy campaign manager for the 1992 Bush campaign.It practically guarantees a full house nightly.And if political
junkies watch the comings and goings of the private dining rooms
carefully, they might just be able to figure out the
behind-the-scene machinations that make Washington tick.</P>
<P>
   In a town where politics has become a very nasty business, the
lobbyists have put aside their differences and come together in one
of their few bipartisan efforts, offering a culinary venue that
fairly sizzles with accommodation _ a steakhouse.

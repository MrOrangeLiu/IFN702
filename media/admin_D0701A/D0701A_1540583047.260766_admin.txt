   VULCAN _ BIRMINGHAM _ From the ground, he still looks like a
Roman god.Vulcan, billed as the world's largest cast-iron statue,
ripples with bronzed metallic muscles as he looms atop Red
Mountain.But if you climb his 123-foot pedestal and stand in the
pigeon poop around his sandaled feet, it's obvious that the man of
iron isn't in peak condition these days.His ankles are rusting.Lime leaches down his calves.Water drips embarrassingly from his
crotch.``Vulcan is like a lot of people you meet in bars,'' says
local deejay Guy ``Beaner'' Patton, ``better looking from a
distance.''(Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).WITH PHOTOS

 &HT;    Neo-Nazis next target of lawyer who broke Klan
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANNING, S.C. _ An hour past midnight, pastor Jonathan Mouzon
sped toward his country church as fast as his Chevy Lumina could
carry him.A section of sky glowed the orange of a fireball.Two
days earlier, the Ku Klux Klan had nailed a flier to the door of
Macedonia Baptist Church.A skull and crossbones on the white paper
illustrated an ominous warning: ``KKK _ is watching you.''</P>
<P>
   No one would torch a house of God, not even the Klan, Mouzon
thought.By the time he pulled up, what looked like a tornado of
fire swirled from the middle of the church roof.Before sunrise,
Macedonia's ashes joined the heap of more than 120 African-American
church fires investigated in the South since 1995.</P>
<P>
   An uneasiness prevailed.``You were constantly looking over your
shoulder,'' said Mouzon, a shift supervisor for a security company.</P>
<P>
   So when a white lawyer from Alabama called offering to sue the
Klan and win justice, some in the Macedonia flock were skeptical.Doubters figured Morris Dees was out to make a buck on their
tragedy.</P>
<P>
   Since co-founding the Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, Dees
has wielded the civil lawsuit like a buck knife, carving financial
assets out of hate group leaders who inspire followers to beat,
burn and kill.He is convinced the best weapons to combat organized
hate are a finely honed legal complaint and a fully loaded bank
account.Now in his legal firing line sits the Aryan Nations, a
white supremacist group in Idaho.On Jan. 25, the Montgomery,
Ala.-based law center filed a lawsuit on behalf of a mother and son
who allege they were assaulted and terrorized by its neo-Nazi
members.The goal is the same legal tactic that worked against the
Klan: seizing the compound and other assets of leader Richard
Butler.</P>
<P>
   Dees had something similar in mind for the Christian Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan, a group he said recruited throughout the
Carolinas.Eventually, leaders of the Christian Knights were
convicted of civil conspiracy _ inciting the fire that destroyed
Macedonia Baptist Church on June 21, 1995.</P>
<P>
   By the next summer, Macedonia stood again.Tucked away in one of
South Carolina's poorest counties, the church took out a $100,000
loan, built a single-story brick sanctuary and went into debt for
the first time in Mouzon's 13 years as pastor.</P>
<P>
   Dees said he could win a multimillion-dollar civil judgment that
would put the South Carolina Klan out of business.Dees explained
how he had won money damages against the Klan before _ one for $7
million in Mobile, Ala., another for $1 million in Forsyth County,
Ga.He told how he had protected Vietnamese fishermen in Texas from
Klan intimidation.</P>
<P>
   ``He was not this enormous person that you read about.He was
one of you,'' Mouzon said recently in the rebuilt church, its
floors covered by carpet as red as Santa's suit.</P>
<P>
   Macedonia signed on.As he does in all his cases, Dees charged
the church nothing.Last summer, his litigators and investigators
secured a $37.8 million judgment against the Christian Knights of
Ku Klux Klan.Even after a court reduced the damages to $20
million, it remains the largest punitive damage ever imposed
against a hate group.</P>
<P>
   The law center estimates it collects less than 2 cents on the
dollar for every successful civil judgment.All money realized from
settlements is given to the victims.</P>
<P>
   What the lawsuits have done, even some Klan leaders have
conceded, is make extremist activity a bad investment, diminishing
the will of financial backers of alleged hate groups.In most of
the cases pursued by Dees, the defendants also have lost what
little property they held.</P>
<P>
   SWAYED BY RECORD
</P>
<P>
   To persuade Macedonia Baptist elders, Dees told them about
Beulah Mae Donald, the elderly mother of 19-year-old Michael
Donald, who was hanged from a tree in downtown Mobile in 1981.Then
64, the cleaning woman agreed to bring suit against the United
Klans of America.</P>
<P>
   She wanted neither vengeance nor money.She wanted justice for
Michael.Dees sought to destroy the corporate Klan.Bank records
showed the UKA had several thousand dues-paying members in 30
states.Depositions and record searches unveiled corporate fronts
designed to hide Klan ownership of a building used as headquarters
in Tuscaloosa.Former Klan members testified that UKA President
Robert Shelton had encouraged violence against blacks.</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy trial lasted four days.An all-white jury of six
found United Klans of America liable and ordered it to pay $7
million to Beulah Mae Donald.The UKA as a machine of hatred had
been shut down.</P>
<P>
   ``The Klan of yesteryear is dead,'' Shelton said in a 1995
interview.``Society's changing.You can't have parades with
Klansmen in robes anymore.The public won't go along with it.The Klan is gone.It will never return.''</P>
<P>
   Donald received the deed to the Klan faction's $125,000
Tuscaloosa headquarters _ the closest she ever got to the $7
million awarded by the jury.She sold the property for half its
appraised value and bought her first house.Donald died in 1988, a
year after the trial.</P>
<P>
   ASSETS UNDER ATTACK
</P>
<P>
   Using civil suits, the Southern Poverty Law Center seizes
whatever assets the targeted hate group owns _ although it never
amounts to the millions of dollars that ring up headlines.In
military terms, Dees goes after command and control centers.</P>
<P>
   Mouzon's church eventually may get only $200,000, if that, the
law center said, from the Christian Knights and Horace King, the
South Carolina grand dragon found guilty of inciting the burning of
the Macedonia Baptist Church.That's only a penny on the dollar.But it will put King on the street and, theoretically, the Klan out
of business.Hate groups are paying attention to Dees' tactics.One
white supremacist group, fearful of being sued by Dees, transferred
its assets to another organization.A federal court ruled in 1996
against the attempted evasion, and the law center now is trying to
collect an $85,000 judgment.</P>
<P>
   A 1996 edition of the ``Florida InterKlan Report,'' a
publication ``serving the Florida Klan cartel,'' focused on Dees'
efforts in Manning.The advice: disband immediately.</P>
<P>
   ``The Klan will always be around under one name or another,''
the newsletter said.``Don't appeal for defense funds.Close your
bank accounts.Forget about lawyers.''</P>
<P>
   A CRUCIAL LINK
</P>
<P>
   But proving organized hate isn't as easy as showing pictures of
flaming crosses to a jury.Newsletters, and Web sites stewing in
fiery rhetoric aren't enough for conviction.The convincing tie-in
comes when a former member of the group testifies against the Klan,
linking rhetoric to violence.</P>
<P>
   In the case of King, the South Carolina grand dragon, the law
center found in its database a video of him at a Klan march in
Washington.In the tape, shown to jurors, King talks about blacks
and yells, ``If we had this garbage in South Carolina, we would
burn the bastards out!''

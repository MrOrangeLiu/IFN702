They said the
boys appeared gleeful.</P>
<P>
   Last spring a group of whites ``armed with brass knuckles and
chanting `white power''' attacked Lance Cpl.Carlos Colbert, a
21-year-old black Marine, as he left a party in San Diego, Calif.
As many as 30 men joined in the assault.Colbert was not killed,
but his neck was broken.He is paralyzed from the neck down.</P>
<P>
   Last May a racially charged exchange in a bar led to the murder
of Mark Dale Butts, a 35-year-old white man.He was beaten to death
in a cemetery in Victor, Colo., by a group of black men and
teen-agers.A shovel was used in the attack.Authorities said Butts
was beaten so hard the handle of the shovel eventually broke.</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, the chief trial counsel of the Law Center, said he
is surprised by what appears to be the increasing frequency and
viciousness of such attacks.They are being committed by whites and
blacks, he said.Much of the hatred is fueled by the growing number
of organized hate groups and the proliferation of Internet sites
devoted to racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other forms of
intolerance.</P>
<P>
   The desire to turn away from a crime as grotesque as the murder
of James Byrd in Jasper, Tex., is understandable.Once justice is
done, what's the point of wallowing in the hideousness of the
crime?</P>
<P>
   But there is a need to understand the rage and the frustrations
and the impulses that lead so many to mayhem in the name of some
warped sense of superiority, or inadequacy, or fear, or whatever.</P>
<P>
   Dragging someone to his death behind a truck may be unusual.But
torturing, maiming and killing people because they fit a certain
despised profile is an everyday occurrence.We can hardly stop it
if we're not even willing to look at it.</P>

DISTURBING LOOKS AT THE SPREAD OF HATRED ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a free country.But two upcoming cable specials may leave
viewers wondering if too much freedom is a bad thing.</P>
<P>
   HBO's ``HATE.COM: Extremists on the Internet'' and Discovery
Channel's ``Warnings from a Small Town'' both look at hate crimes
and at how ``hate sites'' on the Internet are preying on
impressionable young people with low self-esteem.</P>
<P>
   According to ``HATE.COM,'' many acts of domestic terrorism, such
as the Oklahoma City bombing and the attack at a Jewish community
day-care center in Los Angeles, are not the work of ``lone wolves''
but of soldiers in a loosely organized army whose marching orders
come via neo-Nazi, white-supremacist and homophobic Web sites.</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center and a
crusader against intolerance, says the answer is not to censor the
Internet.So-called Internet ``filters'' that remove hateful
language are often misguided, he says.</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think those filter systems are worth very much because
if you eliminate the word `Nazi' you might eliminate a major piece
of history,'' Dees said.``You might eliminate things that would be
positive responses to hate on the Web.</P>
<P>
   ``The best filter,'' he continued, ``is an educated public.''</P>
<P>
   Steven Stroud, a former skinhead who learned to hate as a
teenager in Seattle, couldn't agree more.Before he was taken in by
a loving foster family, Stroud says hating other people, especially
others different from him, made him feel superior.</P>
<P>
   Now a community activist in Portland, Stroud tries to reach
other skinheads by conducting interventions.One such exercise with
a boy named Josh is described in ``Warnings from a Small Town,''
the third installment in Discovery's series, ``Hate &AMP; Violence: No
Simple Answers.''With information from the Internet, Josh created
a model of a concentration camp for a school project and received
an A from his teacher.He showed how whites belong ``on top'' and
all other races belong ``under the ground.''</P>
<P>
   Stroud says kids like Josh often feel that adults have let them
down, through divorce, abuse, etc.</P>
<P>
   ``The youth are looking for something,'' Stroud said.``The kids
are actually looking to this electronic medium for answers they
can't get from adults.''</P>
<P>
   ``Warnings from a Small Town'' airs Aug. 30 on Discovery.``HATE
</P>
<P>
   .COM'' is scheduled to premiere Oct. 23 on HBO.</P>
<P>
   On her most recent shuttle trip last May, U.S. astronaut Mary
Ellen Weber and her crew mates visited the International Space
Station to replace three fire extinguishers, four fans and 10 smoke
detectors because the warranties had expired.</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder Americans don't get jazzed about space
exploration anymore?</P>
<P>
   But Weber says she's OK with that.</P>
<P>
   ``The same way that air travel is not quite the same event that
it was when the Wright brothers flew an airplane, ... that's the
era we're moving into with space,'' says Weber, who has flown on
two shuttle missions and logged more than 450 hours in Earth orbit.</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily about trying to get to one particular
place and all cheer afterwards,'' she says.``We're trying to take
space and adopt it into our lives, to improve our lives, so I'm not
upset at all that there isn't the same amount of excitement.It
just means we've moved on to a much greater level.''</P>
<P>
   Make that split level, as in ``contemporary, high-tech home on
spacious lot with spectacular views.''That's what the
International Space Station will be when construction is completed,
probably in 2005.And even if Weber can forgive America's lack of
enthusiasm for space exploration, the Discovery Channel can't.</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 10, Discovery will air ``Inside the Space Station,'' an
hourlong look at probably the greatest engineering marvel of our
time.It will be the first of four quarterly specials dedicated to
the final frontier.Subsequent programs will look at other moons in
our solar system, violent weather on other planets, and comets,
asteroids and meteors.</P>

LEADERS OF ARYAN NATIONS FOUND NEGLIGENT IN ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 5th graf, adds 6th , 10th and 11th grafs with details)

<P>
   COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Issuing a verdict that civil rights
organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest
white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a
state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan
Nations to pay more than $6 million to the victims of an attack two
years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's
compound near here.</P>
<P>
   Richard Girnt Butler, the 82-year-old self-described pastor of
the Aryan Nations compound, and his deputy, Michael Teague, were
ordered to pay most of the $6.3 million in damages by the
nine-woman, three-man jury.</P>
<P>
   The findings, delivered late Thursday afternoon in the Kootenai
County Courthouse, prompted tearful hugs among the plaintiffs, a
mother and son who were beaten and shot at in the attack, and their
lawyers.The defendants responded defiantly outside the courthouse,
even as protesters shouted at them to stop their ``message of
hate.''</P>
<P>
   The verdict was obtained by lawyers for the Southern Poverty Law
Center, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala., that has
successfully sued the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations.</P>
<P>
   Morris S. Dees Jr., a founder of the center, hailed the jury's
finding as a powerful message against racial intolerance and one
that could force the group out of its 19-acre property.``We intend
to take every single asset from the Aryan Nations now and
forever,'' Dees said at a news conference after the verdict was
announced.``We intend to even take the name Aryan Nations and
hopefully, through the judicial pro- cess, close a sad chapter in
this na- tion's history.''</P>
<P>
   The jury found that Butler and the Aryan Nations were liable for
$4.8 million and Teague was lia- ble for $600,000.The guards were
liable for most of the remaining amount.</P>
<P>
   The multimillion-dollar award also represented the kind of
message from the community that many civic leaders here had openly
sought, hoping that it might help the area to shed what they called
North Idaho's distorted image as a haven for people with racist
views.</P>
<P>
   But Butler scoffed at the verdict, variously comparing himself
to figures in the Bible and to signers of the Declaration of
Independence who were harassed for their views.``This is
nothing,'' he said, after the verdict.``We have planted seeds.''</P>
<P>
   Said Teague: ``The message doesn't take a lot of money.We will
spread the message.''</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the group said an appeal was planned.</P>
<P>
   The extent of group's assets re- mained unclear, raising
questions about whether Butler and his followers, whose numbers
have been described by the local authorities as dwindling, would
pay anything close to the full amount if the award is upheld.Nonetheless, Dees vowed that it was the beginning of the end for
the group and that the verdict was a rebuke of the Aryan Nations
 &UR; -------------------- &LR;  leaders, who were technically found to be
negligent in the training and supervision of the security guards
who carried out the attack.</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son, Jason, now
21, who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the
Aryan Nations in July 1998, had asked the jury for nearly $12
million in compensatory and punitive damages.</P>
<P>
   But the larger purpose of the lawsuit was to bankrupt the Aryan
Nations compound, limit Butler's ability to spread a gospel of
racial hate and persuade the jury to ``return a verdict that will
be heard all over this nation,'' a lawyer for the Keenans, Dees
said in closing arguments.</P>
<P>
   Butler's lawyer, Edgar Steele, argued throughout the six-day
trial that however offensive jurors might find the views of Butler,
he should not be held responsible for the actions of a group of
drunken young men.</P>
<P>
   Steele said the Aryan Nations property was not the incubator of
violence that Dees had portrayed it to be.</P>
<P>
   ``What goes on at Pastor Butler's property,'' he told the
jurors, ``is really more akin to a homeless shelter for exceedingly
politically incorrect misfits, malcontents, borderline derelicts
and all manner of people that drift in and out.''</P>
<P>
   Keenan and her son were attacked after stopping their car near
the entrance to the 19-acre Aryan Nations property near Hayden
Lake, about 20 miles north of here, on their way home from a
wedding.They were looking for a wallet that Keenan had
accidentally dropped from their 1977 Datsun.He had been in the Job
Corps and had thrown his Job Corps card out the window on a whim
and, inadvertently, his wallet along with it.He quickly retrieved
the wallet, but when the car started, it backfired, Keenan told the
police after the incident.</P>
<P>
   At the compound, three guards, one of whom later told the police
that he had thought the place was about to be attacked by militant
Jews, picked up their guns, jumped in a pickup truck and chased the
car.They shot at the car, flattening a rear tire and forcing the
car into a ditch.</P>
<P>
   In tearful testimony, Keenan said one guard, Jesse Warfield, 45,
struck her with the butt of a rifle, grabbed her by the hair and
screamed at her.She and her son testified that they thought they
were going to be killed.</P>
<P>
   Keenan said that she begged the men not to kill her son and that
one of the guards then asked her if she was Indian.She testified
that while she is part Cherokee, she told the men, ``No, I'm a poor
white farm girl.''A guard then said that because they were white,
the men would let them go.</P>
<P>
   At the trial, another security guard, John Yeager, 21, testified
that he was too drunk that night to remember whether he or the
other men had fired at the Keenans.Under questioning, Yeager read
portions of a letter from jail in which he expressed his allegiance
to Butler, saying, ``Next to Christ you are the greatest man to
ever walk the face of this earth.''</P>
<P>
   Yeager and Warfield have pleaded guilty to criminal assault and
are in prison, while the third guard, Shane Wright, 23, remained a
fugitive.The two imprisoned men were brought here for the trial
and testified that they were responsible for their actions, a point
repeated by Steele.</P>

<HEADLINE> Aryan Nations Guards Testify  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- One of two men convicted of
assaulting a woman and her son outside the headquarters of the
Aryan Nations denied being a member of the white supremacist group
Thursday during testimony in a civil rights case filed against
them, the Aryan Nations and the group's founder, Richard Butler.</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law
Center who is representing Victoria Keenan and her son, Jason,
introduced letters, photographs and depositions to contradict the
men's testimony.</P>
<P>
   If the jury awards compensatory and punitive damages, the
Keenans could demand the Aryan Nations' assets, mainly the 20-acre
compound and the sect's buildings.Dees has publicly said he hopes
to bankrupt the Aryan Nations.</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Keenan's lawyers described Jesse Warfield,
43, as a former Aryan Nations security chief and John Yeager, 21,
as former guard for the group.Both men are serving prison
sentences for the 1998 assaults, and another security guard, Shane
Wright, is a fugitive.

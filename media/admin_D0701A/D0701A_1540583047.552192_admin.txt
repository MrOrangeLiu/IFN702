   Butler presides over the Church of Jesus Christ-Christian, which
holds that whites are the true children of God, that Jews are the
offspring of Satan and that blacks and other minorities are
inferior.</P>
<P>
   His disciples have included some of the most notorious figures
in the white supremacist movement, such as Robert Mathews, who
founded a neo-Nazi offshoot of the Aryan Nations, and Buford
Furrow, who is awaiting trial in Los Angeles on charges of killing
an Asian-American postal carrier and shooting up a Jewish day care
center last summer.</P>
<P>
   From his compound, which is valued at about $200,000 and has a
sign out front that reads ''Whites only,'' Butler mails his
literature, recruits followers and plays host to the annual Aryan
World Congress, a skinhead symposium that often draws more than 100
acolytes.The gathering is generally held on Adolf Hitler's
birthday.</P>

   Dees has long used lawsuits to destroy the finances of hate
groups.In six such lawsuits, the Montgomery, Ala., lawyer has
never lost.</P>

   In 1987, Dees won a $7 million verdict against a Ku Klux Klan
organization over the slaying of a 19-year-old black man in Mobile,
Ala., forcing the group to turn over its headquarters building.In
1990, he won $9 million in Portland, Ore., against the White Aryan
Resistance in the beating death of a black man by neo-Nazi
skinheads.</P>

<HEADLINE> Report: Hate Groups Growing in United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of organized hate
groups in the United States grew last year, mostly through new
chapters of established white power organizations, the Southern
Poverty Law Center said in a report released Tuesday.</P>
<P>
The research group based in Mongomery, Alabama, said 474 hate
groups and their chapters engaged in some form of racist behavior
in 1997, The Associated Press reported.</P>
<P>
The center used a different methodology to count the groups so
previous numbers cannot be directly compared.But if the old
methodology had been used, the latest figures would represent a 20
percent increase from 1996.</P>
<P>
Most of the newer groups, according to the center, come from a
growth in the number of chapters of groups like the Ku Klux Klan
and churches belonging to the Christian Identity movement, whose
followers cite the Bible as the source for their racist views.</P>
<P>
The growth in hate groups has been fueled by the Internet and
rock music touting white power and advocating violence against
minorities, the report said.It said there are 163 Web sites that
advocate racial hatred; less than three years ago, there was one.</P>
<P>
The report said one chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, the American
Knights, expanded from one to 12 chapters last year and that
racist and neo-Nazi Skinheads made a violent comeback in Denver,
Los Angeles and the Pacific Northwest.</P>
<P>
The Southern Poverty Law Center, which was founded in the 1970s
to battle racial bias, won major legal fights against the Ku Klux
Klan and other white supremacist groups.More recently it has been
tracking hate crimes and the spread of racist organizations across
the United States.</P>

WILBERT OLIVER, 89, WHO INFLUENCED FUNERAL-HOME POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ill., Texas, S.C.)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN

<P>
   Wilbert Jean Oliver, whose 1973 federal lawsuit had the
practical effect of forcing funeral homes throughout the United
States to provide equal services to blacks and whites, died on
Tuesday at a hospital in Marksville, La.He was 89 and lived in
Mansura, La.</P>
<P>
   Oliver sued the Escude Funeral Home in Mansura, where he lived
all his life, for discrimination after it refused to provide
visitation for his deceased mother, Martha Pierre Oliver, because
she was black.</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights
organization in Montgomery, Ala., advanced his case in federal
court, charging that the Escude Funeral Home and Hixson Brothers
Funeral Home in Avoyelles Parish either refused to deal with blacks
or offered ``distinctly inferior services'' for the same prices
that they charged whites.</P>
<P>
   Oliver won his case.</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, the chief trial counsel of the Southern Poverty Law
Center and a member of the original team of lawyers that handled
the case, said, ``Although the case was not binding, because it
never reached the Supreme Court, it served notice to funeral homes,
and even cemeteries and other businesses, that if they practiced
discrimination against blacks they could be violating federal
law.''</P>
<P>
   Dees said that after the ruling was announced, his organization
heard reports from across the country that previously segregated
funeral homes had begun to offer a full line of service to black
clients.</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless,'' he said, ``black funeral homes continue to
prosper in the South as a matter of choice.''</P>
<P>
   Gaon Escude, a spokesman for the funeral home, said that his
grandfather, who operated the home at the time of the lawsuit,
provided all services, including embalming, but stopped at offering
visitation to blacks ``because, if he did, he thought he'd lose
business from whites.''</P>
<P>
   He added that his grandfather's competitors at the time would
not accept any black clients at all.</P>
<P>
   The Rev.August Thompson, who was Oliver's priest when his
mother died, said Oliver had been distraught when he was told that
the funeral home would not permit visitation for his mother.</P>
<P>
   ``He lived in what used to be called a shotgun house, because it
was so flimsy that if you fired a shotgun at the house it would go
right through it,'' Thompson said.``He wanted a better place for
visitation for his mother.''</P>
<P>
   After the Escude Funeral Home rejected his request, Oliver, a
salesman for John Deere, arranged to hold the wake in what was
described in his lawsuit as ``a run-down storage building on the
grounds of Our Lady of Prompt Succor Church.''</P>
<P>
   Oliver is survived by his wife, Catherine Carmouche Oliver of
Mansura; two sons, Wilbert Jr. of Chicago and Carroll of Kingwood,
Texas; a foster son, Francis Sarpy of Charleston, S.C.; six
daughters, Catherine Demouy and Jacqueline Batiste of Mansura,
Sister Laurita Oliver of New Orleans, Eloise Lee of DeRidder, La.,
Geraldine Barbin of Marksville and Hattie Turner of Alexandria,
La.; 39 grandchildren; 72 great-grandchildren, and 13
great-great-grandchildren.</P>
<P>
   ``He was just an ordinary man, one of the common people and not
a crusader,'' Thompson said.``Life was a little harder for him
because he had lost his left arm in an accident, but none of the
local lawyers would touch the case.I directed him to Julian Bond,
who was then president of the Southern Poverty Law Center.Bond
took the case and within a month it was decided.''</P>

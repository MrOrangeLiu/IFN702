</P>
<P>
   And officials in Philadelphia, Miss., despite urging from the
families of the victims, are not saying publicly whether they are
investigating or will try to prosecute in state court any of the 18
men indicted on federal civil rights charges in the slaying of
three civil rights workers there in 1964.</P>
<P>
   Seven of those 18 were convicted on federal charges, including
Bowers, but none has ever been tried by the state for the
Philadelphia killings.</P>
<P>
   Baxley, the former Alabama attorney general who prosecuted the
Birmingham bombing case in 1977, said some of the same problems he
encountered 20 years ago still exist.For instance, he said his
main concern in 1977 was to show the jury that Chambliss, by then a
frail 74-year-old, was once capable of killing four children.</P>
<P>
   ``It worried me,'' Baxley said, ``that they would look at him
and think how could this old man be a threat to anybody.So we had
to let the jury see that this is not a harmless old grandfather or
uncle.They had to see the evil in this man.''</P>
<P>
   Other major impediments to getting convictions are aging
witnesses with failing memories, or key witnesses who have already
died.In some of the slayings, no case files exist and no
transcripts from trials on federal charges exist, as they do in
better-known cases like the Evers slaying, the killings of the
Philadelphia, Miss., rights workers and the Birmingham church
bombing.</P>
<P>
   Another hurdle in the Birmingham case in 1977 was that people
remained afraid of retaliation from the Klan.Two major witnesses,
whose testimony Baxley believed might have helped convict others in
the bombing, refused to testify.</P>
<P>
   These days, some of that fear persists, but it is far less
potent.In the Birmingham case this summer, the third of Cherry's
five wives told reporters before her grand jury testimony that
Cherry had admitted his involvement in the bombing and had bragged
about it.</P>
<P>
   ``Not all people remain the same all through their lives,'' said
Joseph Lewis, 47, head of the Birmingham division of the FBI, which
has been investigating the case since 1996.``When they are getting
close to their final days, they may say, `Well, it's time to clear
my conscience before I meet my maker.'That's what you hope for in
cases like this.''</P>

<HEADLINE> Idaho's Racist Image May Change  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN K. WILEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- Northern Idaho, predominantly white
and rural, has been home for nearly three decades to the racist
Aryan Nations.It has struggled with a reputation as a haven for
hate.</P>
<P>
   But residents say a $6.3 million jury verdict returned Thursday
against Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler and three of his
followers for attacking two people near the sect's compound may be
the first step toward rehabilitating the region's image.</P>
<P>
   ''It's a small step for human rights, one giant step for
Idaho,'' said Marshall Mend, a human rights activist whose home and
business were allegedly targeted for firebombings by Aryan Nations
members.</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Kootenai County said, 'No more hate.'I see it
as being very, very positive,'' Mend said.</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center
in Montgomery, Ala., and one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs,
said he intended to enforce the judgment, taking everything the
Aryan Nations owns, including its trademark name.</P>
<P>
   He even suggested turning the 20-acre Aryan Nations compound
into a center for tolerance, teaching about the Holocaust.</P>
<P>
   But putting a hate group out of business isn't easy: While Dees
has won significant civil judgments against the Ku Klux Klan and
the White Aryan Resistance, the groups have survived.</P>
<P>
   Brian Levin, a California State University professor who has
studied hate groups, said legal moves have damaged the groups but
their strong ideology has proved as vital as funding.</P>
<P>
   ''What lawsuits can't do is cripple a movement,'' Levin said,
adding that racist organizations now focus on small cells of
individuals, rather than larger, organized groups such as Butler's.</P>
<P>
   New technology, especially the Internet, also has allowed
extremists to reach a much larger audience at less cost.Some
organizations also have their own wealthy patrons.</P>
<P>
   In Butler's case, Vincent Bertollini, a self-styled evangelist
in the anti-Semitic 11th Hour Remnant Messenger of Sandpoint,
offered to pick up the expenses.</P>
<P>
   Bertollini reportedly made millions in California's Silicon
Valley before moving to northern Idaho to found his sect, which
pays for mass mailings of Christian Identity tracts.</P>
<P>
   ''The money is nothing.It's the idea,'' Bertollini said after
the verdict.''What we are sending is a message.I can do it in any
city in the country.The message is separatism.''</P>
<P>
   Butler, in fact, appeared confident after the verdict.Outside
the courtroom, the 82-year-old Butler said Idaho's Panhandle would
continue to be a haven for racists.</P>
<P>
   Friday, he applied for a parade permit to march in downtown
Coeur d'Alene either Oct. 15 or Oct. 28, said Julia Aho, deputy
city clerk.The application will be reviewed by police, who will
consider security issues, and then turned over to city leaders for
possible approval.</P>
<P>
   The group's parade in 1998 attracted about 100 followers and
many more counter-demonstrators.In 1999, fewer than two dozen
marched.</P>
<P>
   Kootenai County has about 220 blacks in an estimated population
of more than 100,000, Mend said.He downplayed Butler's claims,
saying only about 100 Aryan Nations members lived in the state.</P>
<P>
   While Butler has never been convicted of any crime, his group
has attracted neo-Nazis, supremacists and separatists to the
region.</P>
<P>
   Most notorious of these groups was The Order, a violent offshoot
that embarked on a nationwide crime spree in the 1980s, including
armored car robberies and the slaying of Jewish talk show host Alan
Berg in Denver.Most of the group's followers are in jail and its
leader was killed during a 1984 shoot-out with the FBI.</P>
<P>
   In this week's case, jurors found that Butler, his organization
and its corporate entity were negligent in the selecting and
overseeing security guards who assaulted Victoria and Jason Keenan
in 1998.</P>
<P>
   The Keenans were chased, shot at and assaulted after they
stopped to search for a dropped wallet near the entrance to the
Aryan Nations' compound.Jurors set $6 million as the punitive
award.</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to bury the whole Aryan Nations,'' Judy Jacobson
said of her fellow jurors.The 45-year-old carpet layer said she
and two other jurors prevented the panel from awarding a much
higher judgment.</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to get the Aryan Nations out of the country,'' she
said.''I'm not going to force this guy out of his property and his
home, just because you don't believe in his beliefs.''</P>

<HEADLINE> Butler: Racists To Stay in Idaho  </HEADLINE>
By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAYDEN LAKE, Idaho (AP) -- Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler
vowed Saturday he will not leave northern Idaho, despite a $6.3
million judgment against his racist organization.</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on the 20-acre Aryan Nations compound,
Butler said he did not have the $960,000 in cash bond that would be
required for him to appeal the judgment issued Thursday by a civil
jury Thursday.</P>
<P>
   But he said his neo-Nazi sect would continue, even if the
compound is seized to pay the judgment as he expects.</P>
<P>
   ''They cannot run me out of northern Idaho with my tail between
my legs,'' Butler said from a church pulpit, standing next to a
silver bust of Adolf Hitler.He said he may seek a new trial.</P>
<P>
   A jury found that Butler and his organization were negligent in
selecting and overseeing security guards who assaulted Victoria
Keenan and her son Jason in 1998.Jurors awarded the damages to the
Keenans, who were chased, shot at and assaulted after they stopped
their car near the entrance to the Aryan Nations' compound.</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery, Ala., represented the Keenans and has said he intends
to take everything the Aryan Nations owns to pay the judgment,
including the sect's name.</P>
<P>
   Butler compared his trial to trials in the former Soviet Union
under dictator Josef Stalin.He said local ''politicians want to
improve the image of Idaho by mongrelizing the white race up
here.''</P>
<P>
   Idaho politicians and community leaders expressed hope after
last week's judgment that Butler would leave the area and take his
organization with him.</P>
<P>
   Instead, Butler, 82, has applied for a permit to hold another
parade down the streets of nearby Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, in October.</P>
<P>
   He bemoaned the expected loss of the compound, which he bought
nearly 30 years ago and includes his home and church and has been
the site of annual gatherings by his supporters.</P>
<P>
   ''This place was built on love,'' Butler said.''It is a place
to worship with your own kind.''</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that two wealthy computer industry
executives who have been supportive of Butler in recent years might
come to his financial aid.But Butler said Saturday that he has not
asked Vincent Bertollini or Carl Story, both of Sandpoint, Idaho,
to pay the judgment.</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have that kind of money,'' Butler said.''We never
talked about it.''</P>
<P>
   Butler also praised attorney Edgar Steele of Sandpoint for
taking his case, even though he said Steele did not share the Aryan
Nations' views.</P>
<P>
   ''Mister Steele took the case for me out of his concern for
freedom of speech,'' Butler said.''For the past two weeks, freedom
of speech has been on trial.''</P>

COMMENTARY: STARING AT HATRED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How deep is the hatred?</P>
<P>
   After being sentenced to death in Jasper, Texas, last week, John
William King was asked if he had anything to say to the relatives
of his victim, James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man who was
chained to a pickup truck and dragged along a country road until
his body literally was torn apart.</P>
<P>
   King, a 24-year-old white supremacist, did have something to
say.Grinning, he assured all within earshot that Byrd's grieving
survivors were welcome to perform a sex act on him.</P>
<P>
   Most Americans would like to believe that the attack on Byrd was
an aberration, that it was so far over the top, so sick and
inhumane, that it should not be viewed as representative of a much
larger societal problem.The reasoning is more or less as follows:
The vast majority of Americans were repelled by the murder, arrests
were made quickly, and the legal steps toward the ultimate societal
sanction already are being taken.Let's move on.</P>
<P>
   That attitude presupposes that race hatred and other forms of
prejudice and intolerance in America are not nearly as deep or as
dangerous as the attack on Byrd might suggest.</P>
<P>
   A long litany of tragedies tells us otherwise.</P>
<P>
   Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student in Wyoming, died
last fall after he was kidnapped, robbed, tied to a fence, beaten
in the head with a .357 Magnum, tortured with cigarettes, taunted
as he wept and begged for his life, and finally left alone and
helpless in near-freezing temperatures.Authorities said he was
murdered, at least in part, because he was gay.</P>
<P>
   A recent report from the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery, Ala., which tracks hate crimes and hate groups across
the country, is filled with other horrible examples that occurred
last year.</P>
<P>
   In February, the report said, a dark-haired young woman named
Amy Robinson was abducted in Fort Worth, Texas, and murdered by two
white men who used her for target practice.They were reported to
have burst out laughing when she died.The original plan, according
to one of the men, was ``to go out and shoot black folks.''Ms.
Robinson was chosen because the men thought she was biracial.They
were mistaken.Ms. Robinson was, in fact, white.</P>
<P>
   In October in Buffalo, N.Y., a group of black teen-agers
attacked a 41-year-old white man, Gary Trzaska, as he was walking
to his car.Trzaska, who was gay, was beaten and stomped to death.Witnesses said they saw the teen-agers jumping high in the air so
they could land on Trzaska's head with both feet.

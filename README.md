# Prerequisites
Itâ€™s a good idea to keep all your virtual environments in one place, for example in .virtualenvs/ in your home directory.

Create a new virtual environment by running:
MacOS & Linux:
$ python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev
Windows:
> py -m venv %HOMEPATH%\.virtualenvs\djangodev

The path is where the new environment will be saved on your computer.

The final step in setting up your virtual environment is to activate it:
$ source ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev/bin/activate

# Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine, and then:
pip install -r requirements.txt
